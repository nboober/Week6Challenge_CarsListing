**Week Six Challenge: Cars Listing**

**Heroku Link**

https://salty-springs-71729.herokuapp.com/

Your client is a car dealership. Their competitor across the street has a site that looks like this: https://polar-anchorage-42314.herokuapp.com/ (Links to an external site.)

They want a site that will give them the same capabilities: the ability to add, update, delete and list cars for sale; the ability to put those cars in categories and show the cars in a category.

It can't look EXACTLY like that site, that's how you get sued.
Don't over-complicate it. Simplicity is best.
Start with the H2 database or MySQL.
Use Bootstrap to style your site and make it look good.
Grading Criteria:

**Add categories**
 - Add cars
 - When adding cars, assign a category to that car
 - Update car information
 - Delete cars
 - View car details
 - List cars that were added
 - List categories

**If finished, proceed to additional criteria:**

When the user clicks on a category, they will be given a list of cars under that category
Add cars with photos (Cloudinary optional)
Update photos of cars
Deploy your application to Heroku after you switch the database to PostgreSQL.
